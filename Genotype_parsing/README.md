Genotype preprocessing and quality control is its own process, considered seperately from QTL analysis. The code used to perform genotype quality control can be found [here](https://github.com/RyanSchu/gwasqc_pipeline). The code to prepare items for imputation can be found [here]() and the code used to parse this data into dosage format can be found [here](https://github.com/WheelerLab/Imputation)
