this directory titled artifact code contains code that since its first implementation has been rendered redundant by implementation of other softwares or updating of other scripts. Although not to be used in the final implementation of this pipeline, the purpose of this folder is to maintain code who's overlying architecture may prove useful for reference. The way a few lines are written or a particularly tedious library is used may lend itself to future updates.
